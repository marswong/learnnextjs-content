  intro: `
In the previous lesson, we learned how to create dynamic pages with query strings.
With that, a link to one of our blog posts looks like this:

http://localhost:3000/post?title=Hello%20Next.js

But that URL doesn't look nice.
How about if we had something like this?

http://localhost:3000/p/hello-nextjs

It would be awesome, right?
That's exactly what we are trying to do with this lesson.

## Setup

First of all, we need a simple Next.js app to play with. Try to download the following example app:

~~~sh
git clone https://github.com/arunoda/learnnextjs-demo.git
cd learnnextjs-demo
git checkout clean-urls
~~~

You can run it with:

~~~sh
npm install
npm run dev
~~~

Now you can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000/.

## Route Masking

Here, we are going to use a unique feature of Next.js called route masking. Basically, it will show a different URL on the browser than the actual URL that your app sees.

Let's add a route mask to our blog post URL.

Use the following code for the \`pages/index.js\`:

~~~js
import Layout from '../components/MyLayout.js'
import Link from 'next/link'

const PostLink = (props) => (
  <li>
    <Link as={\`/p/\${props.id}\`} href={\`/post?title=\${props.title}\`}>
      <a>{props.title}</a>
    </Link>
  </li>
)

export default () => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>My Blog</h1>
    <ul>
      <PostLink id="hello-nextjs" title="Hello Next.js"/>
      <PostLink id="learn-nextjs" title="Learn Next.js is awesome"/>
      <PostLink id="deploy-nextjs" title="Deploy apps with Zeit"/>
    </ul>
  </Layout>
)
~~~

Have look at the following code block:

~~~js
const PostLink = (props) => (
  <li>
    <Link as={\`/p/\${props.id}\`} href={\`/post?title=\${props.title}\`}>
      <a>{props.title}</a>
    </Link>
  </li>
)
~~~

In the \`<Link>\` element, we have used another prop called “as”. That's the URL which we need to show on the browser. The URL your app sees is mentioned in the “href” prop.

---

Now try to click on the first blog post and you'll be navigated to the blog post.

After that, hit the **back** button and then hit the **forward** button. What will happen?
      `
    },

    {
      id: 'history-awareness',
      type: 'text',
      points: 5,
      text: `
## History Awareness

As you have witnessed, route masking works pretty nicely with the browser history.
All you have to do is just add the “as” prop for the link.

    },

        'The page will render the first blog post as expected.',
        'It won\'t load the page, but keep loading continuously.',
        'It will throw a 500 error.',
        'It will throw a 404 error.'
      ],
      correctAnswer: 'It will throw a 404 error.',
      text: `
## Reload

Now go to the home page: http://localhost:3000/
Then click on the first post title. You'll be navigated to the post page.

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/50838/24586820/b65be244-17c6-11e7-87fd-d6880152261e.png)

Then reload the browser. What will happen?
      `
    },

    {
      id: '404',
      type: 'text',
      points: 5,
      text: `
## 404

It gives us a 404 error. That's because there is no such page to load on the server.
The server will try to load the page \`p/hello-nextjs\`, but we only have two pages: \`index.js\` and \`post.js\`.

With this, we can't run this app in production. We need to fix this.

**Next.js's [custom server API](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#custom-server-and-routing) is the solution for this problem.**

We are going to learn how to use it in the next lesson.
