  intro: `
Now we know how to create a simple Next.js app and run it. Our simple app only had a single page, but we can add as many pages as we want. For example, we can create an "About" page by adding the following content to \`pages/about.js\`:

~~~js
export default () => (
  <div>
    <p>This is the about page</p>
  </div>
)
~~~

Then we can access that page with http://localhost:3000/about.

After that, we need to connect these pages. We could use an HTML "a" tag for that. However, it won't perform client-side navigation; it navigates to the page via the server, which is not what we want.

In order to support client-side navigation, we need to use Next.js's Link API, which is exported via \`next/link\`.

Let's see how to use it.

## Setup

In order to follow along with this lesson, you need to have a simple Next.js app. For that, continue your work from the previous lesson or download the following example app:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/arunoda/learnnextjs-demo.git
cd learnnextjs-demo
git checkout navigate-between-pages.
~~~

You can run it with:

~~~bash
npm install
npm run dev
~~~

Now you can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000/.

## Using Link

Now we are going to use \`next/link\` to link our two pages.

Add the following code into \`pages/index.js\`

~~~js
// This is the Link API
import Link from 'next/link'

const Index = () => (
  <div>
    <Link href="/about">
      <a>About Page</a>
    </Link>
    <p>Hello Next.js</p>
  </div>
)

export default Index
~~~

Here we've imported \`next/link\` as \`Link\` and use it like this:

~~~js
<Link href="/about">
  <a>About Page</a>
</Link>
~~~

Now try to visit http://localhost:3000/

Then click the "About Page" link. It will navigate you to the "About" page.

> This is client-side navigation; the action takes place in the browser, without making a request to the server.
> You can verify this by opening your browser's network request inspector.


Okay, now we have a simple task for you:

* Visit http://localhost:3000/
* Then click the "About Page"
* Then hit your browser's Back button

How would you best describe the experience of the Back button?

## Client-Side History Support

When you hit the Back button, it navigates the page to the index page entirely via the client; \`next/link\` does all the [\`location.history\`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API) handling for you.

You don't need to write even a single line of client-side routing code.

Simply link pages; it just works!

## Styling a Link

Most of the time, we may want to style our links. This is how we can do it:

~~~js
<Link href="/about">
  <a style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>About Page</a>
</Link>
~~~

Once we add this, you can see the style applied correctly.

How about doing this instead?

~~~js
<Link href="/about" style={{ fontSize: 20 }}>
  <a>About Page</a>
</Link>
~~~

What has happened with the above code change?

## Link is Just a Higher Order Component (HOC)

Actually, the style prop on \`next/link\` has no effect. That's because \`next/link\` is just a [higher order component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html) which only accepts the "href" and some similar props. If you need to style it, you need to do it to the underlying component.

In this case, it's our anchor.

## Link With a Button

Let's say that we need to use a "button" instead of an anchor for our link. Then we need to edit our navigation code like this:

~~~js
<Link href="/about">
  <button>Go to About Page</button>
</Link>
~~~

What will happen when you click the button on the index page?

## Link Works With Anything

Just like a button, you can place any of your custom React components or even a \`div\` within a Link.

The only requirement for components placed inside a Link is they should accept an \`onClick\` prop.

## Link is Simple, but Powerful

Here we've only looked at the very basic usage of \`next/link\`. There are some interesting ways to use it, and we'll learn about them in upcoming lessons.

In the meantime, have a look at the [Next.js Routing documentation](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#routing). You'll find it useful.
